## Hybridization Chain Reaction in situ probe generator for the command line
Generate HCR-3.0-style Probe Pairs for fluorescent *in situ* mRNA visualization

### Intention of this program:

We were excited to venture into the realm of quick, easy, mutliplexable *in situ* hybridizations presented by the Hybridization Chain Reaction methodology (Choi et al. Development 2018) . We wanted a budget-friendly way of exploring gene expression that allowed for complete control over probe design, while allowing us to also know the exact sequences of our probes to aid publication and reproducibility. As a result, we wrote this program to allow us ease of ordering probes that mesh with the published HCR system of reaction and amplification reagents.
